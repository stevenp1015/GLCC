# Gemini Legion Command & Control

**Your Tactical Interface for Managing Autonomous AI Agents.**

---

## Overview

The Gemini Legion Command & Control (C&C) is a sophisticated, real-time web application designed for the deployment, management, and observation of a company of autonomous AI agents, known as "Minions." Built with a highly responsive React frontend, it simulates the behavior of a powerful Python-based backend, allowing for complex, dynamic, and persistent multi-agent interactions.

This interface is the Commander's viewport into the Legion's operations, providing tools for direct communication, agent configuration, and the orchestration of complex, emergent group behaviors.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Dynamic Multi-Agent Conversation:** Engage in real-time chat with multiple, distinct AI Minions, each with its own unique persona, model configuration, and emotional state.
*   **Granular Agent Configuration:** Deploy, decommission, and reconfigure Minions on the fly. Adjust their core persona, underlying Gemini model (including custom models), and operational parameters like temperature.
*   **The Emotional Engine:** Minions maintain internal "opinion scores" of each other and the Commander, which dynamically influence their response mode, tone, and willingness to speak.
*   **Autonomous Swarm Mode:** Designate specific channels for Minions to converse with *each other* without direct user intervention. A sophisticated orchestration model ensures natural, turn-based conversation flow.
*   **Conversation Pacing Control:** When in Swarm mode, precisely control the rhythm of the conversation with configurable fixed or random delays between messages.
*   **Full Channel & Membership Management:** Create custom channels for different purposes and manually assign/un-assign specific Minions to control who participates in which conversation.
*   **API Key Management & Load Balancing:** Add a pool of your own Gemini API keys to be used by the Minions. The system automatically load-balances requests across your keys in a round-robin fashion to avoid rate limits, with the option to assign specific keys to specific Minions.
*   **Live Observability:** The interface provides a live audit trail of which Minion is using which API key for each request, and a detailed look into each Minion's internal "diary" after they speak.
*   **Persistent State:** All Minions, channels, messages, and API keys are saved to browser `localStorage`, ensuring your entire session is preserved across reloads.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project currently operates as a self-contained web application that brilliantly simulates a full-stack environment.

*   **Frontend:** A dynamic and responsive single-page application built with **React** (using Hooks and TypeScript) and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
*   **Backend (Simulated):** A comprehensive service module, `services/legionApiService.ts`, acts as a high-fidelity mock of a Python backend. It manages all application state (Minions, channels, messages) and orchestrates the complex multi-agent logic, persisting all data to the browser's `localStorage`. This file is the primary specification for the real Python backend.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This application is designed to run in a self-contained browser-based development environment. No installation is required. Simply load the application, and the Legion will be ready for your command.

## üìñ How to Use (Commander's Guide)

### 1. Deploying Your First Minion
1.  Click the **Cog icon** in the top-right corner to open the Minion Roster panel.
2.  Click **"Deploy New Minion"**.
3.  Fill out the configuration:
    *   **Minion Name:** A unique name for your agent (e.g., "Alpha", "Charlie").
    *   **Model:** Choose a standard Gemini model or select **"Custom Model..."** to manually enter a model ID and a friendly name.
    *   **Persona & Fire Code:** This is the critical system prompt that defines the Minion's personality, goals, and rules of engagement.
    *   **Temperature:** Control the creativity/randomness of the Minion's responses.
4.  Click **"Save Minion Configuration"**. Your new Minion is now deployed.

### 2. Managing API Keys
1.  From the Minion Roster panel, click **"Manage API Keys"**.
2.  In the modal, provide a name for your key (e.g., "Personal Key 1") and paste the key value.
3.  Click the **Plus icon** to add it to your pool.
4.  You can now assign this key to a specific Minion during its configuration, or leave it as "Default" to be used in the load-balancing pool.

### 3. Creating & Managing Channels
1.  In the left-hand sidebar, click the **Plus icon** to create a new channel.
2.  Define its name, description, and **Channel Type**.
3.  Use the **"Manage Members"** section to select which deployed Minions will be active in this channel.
4.  Click the **Pencil icon** next to any existing channel to edit its properties and membership at any time.

### 4. The Autonomous Swarm
1.  Create a channel and set its type to **"Autonomous Swarm"**. Assign at least two Minions as members.
2.  Send an initial prompt to kick off the conversation (e.g., "Introduce yourselves and discuss your purpose.").
3.  Use the **Control Panel** at the top of the chat view:
    *   Press **Play** to begin the autonomous loop. The Minions will start talking to each other based on your initial prompt.
    *   Press **Pause** to stop the loop. The chat input will become enabled, allowing you to interject with new guidance.
    *   Adjust the **Fixed** or **Random** delay timers to change the pacing of the conversation.

## The Road Ahead: Activating the Python Backend

The next monumental step for this project is to replace the simulated backend (`legionApiService.ts`) with a real, robust Python server powered by the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

The existing Python files in this workspace (`main_backend.py`, `minion_core.py`, etc.) serve as a foundational starting point. They correctly mirror the API contract required by the frontend.

The mission, as outlined in the `MISSION BRIEFING` prompt, is to refactor these Python files to:
1.  Convert `MinionAgent` into a proper `adk.core.LlmAgent`.
2.  Replace all in-memory data storage with the ADK's persistent `Store`.
3.  Integrate ADK `Tool`s to give the Minions real capabilities.
4.  Leverage ADK `Memory` for more sophisticated context management.

The `legionApiService.ts` file should be treated as the official **specification** for the backend's required behavior and API surface.
